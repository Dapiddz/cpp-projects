# CPP-projects
A personal journey of my C++ development 
# C++ Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my C++ learning repository!

This is where I track my progress as I learn and practice C++ programming — from writing simple programs like a basic calculator to more advanced mini-projects. Each folder reflects a new step in my journey, with continuous improvements, refactoring, and learning.

## Projects so far:
- ✅ Simple calculator
- ✅ Pizza simulator
- ⏳ More coming soon...

Feel free to follow along or suggest improvements!
